# About Box Component #

This project contains one unit - _PJAbout_ that implements the non-visual _[TPJAboutBoxDlg](TPJAboutBoxDlg.md)_ about box component. It also defines the _TPJAboutBoxForm_ form class that implements the actual about box. This class is not documented and should not be accessed directly.

A demo program showing how to use the component is included with the download.
