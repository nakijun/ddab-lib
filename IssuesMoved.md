# Issues Moved #

Following Google's announcement that GoogleCode is to close, the DelphiDabbler code library issue tracker has now been moved to [SourceForge's ticket system](https://sourceforge.net/p/ddablib/tickets/).

**Please do not open new tickets here - use the SourceForge ticket system instead**.
