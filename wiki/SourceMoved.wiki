= Source Code Moved =

Following Google's announcement that !GoogleCode is to close, the !DelphiDabbler code library source code has now been moved to [https://sourceforge.net/p/ddablib/code/ SourceForge]. The code continues to be managed using !SubVersion.

For the time being the old !SubVersion repo on !GoogleCode will still exist but it will not be updated after 14th March 2015. Any updates after this date will only be applied to the !SourceForge repo.
