=Downloads Moved=

All the download files from this project have now been moved to _!SourceForge_. Given that Google has announced that _!GoogleCode_ is to close, please amend any bookmarks ASAP.

Downloads can now be accessed via the _!SourceForge_ [https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddablib/files/ File Manager].

Each of the library's sub-projects has its own directory in the File Manager where its releases are stored. These are as follows:
