# Downloads Moved #

All the download files from this project have now been moved to _SourceForge_. Given that Google has announced that _GoogleCode_ is to close, please amend any bookmarks ASAP.

Downloads can now be accessed via the _SourceForge_ [File Manager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddablib/files/).

Each of the library's sub-projects has its own directory in the File Manager where its releases are stored. These are as follows:
